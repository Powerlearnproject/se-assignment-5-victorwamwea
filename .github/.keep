Prerequisites:

Windows 11 operating system (32-bit or 64-bit)
Internet connection
Steps:

Download: Visit the official VS Code download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
Choose Installer: Select the appropriate installer based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). It's usually recommended to download the 64-bit version unless you have a specific reason to use the 32-bit version.
Run Installer: Double-click the downloaded installer (.exe file).
Installation Process: Follow the on-screen instructions. By default, VS Code installs to "C:\Users&lt;username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code". You can choose a different location if desired.
Create Desktop Shortcut (Optional): During installation, you can choose to create a desktop shortcut for easy access.
First-time Setup:

Font Size: Adjust the font size (Settings > Editor > Font Size) for better readability.
Extensions: Install essential extensions (Extensions icon in the Activity Bar). Here are some examples for web development:
HTML (CSS) Tools: Improves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editing experience.
Live Server: Launches a development server to preview code changes in a web browser.
ESLint: Provides code linting and static analysis for JavaScript code.
Settings: Explore other settings to customize keyboard shortcuts (Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts) and various editor behaviors (Settings > Editor).
User Interface Overview:
Activity Bar (Left): Provides access to common actions like opening files, searching, debugging, and extensions.
